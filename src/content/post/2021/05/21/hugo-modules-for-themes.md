The [tutorial](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for Hugo tells you how to install themes in step 3. 
This is great because you probably want to pick one of the hundreds of beautiful 3rd party themes to get hugo to do what you want it to do.

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo theme = \"ananke\" >> config.toml
```

This has some problems. 
Mainly that I don't want to learn how to work with git submodules ðŸ˜„ but also.. I don't understand git submodules ðŸ™„.
But I don't have to! Apparently Hugo has created the concept of [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/). 
They are basically [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).

### How do you use them?

Firstly you have to make your site a Go module, hugo can help you with this.

`hugo mod init <any-name-you-want>`

Then you add your themes/modules to a hugo module config.

```toml
[[imports]]
    path = "github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke"
```
_Notice that the path does not include `https://` or `.git`. Don't add them, it won't work._

Lastly delete the git submodules in `/themes`, git submodule config (`.gitsubmodules` file) and the `theme = "ananke"` from `config.toml`. Done!

As a little extra here are some nice hugo modules I've recently started using, which you can try to add as a hu(go) module!
